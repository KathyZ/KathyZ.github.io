<p>

Queenly, Inc (hereafter referred to as “Queenly,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides a mobile application that connects users who own formal wear fashion items to sell with other users looking to buy such items through our buyer driven model of ISO "in search of" process.
<p>
QUEENLY IS A MOBILE PLATFORM THROUGH WHICH USERS MAY POST AN ISO THROUGH WHICH THEY WILL STATE THE ITEM THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR, AND THEN OTHER USERS WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE OFFERS IN ORDER TO SELL THESE ITEMS TO THE ISO BUYER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT QUEENLY IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS, NOR IS QUEENLY A CLOTHING BROKER, AGENT, OR INSURER. QUEENLY HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE CONDUCT OF ALL USERS OF THE SITE, OR ANY ITEM EXCHANGE, AND DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY IN THIS REGARD.
<p>
Payment processing services for Queenly are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these Terms or continuing to operate as a User on Queenly, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement and their terms and conditions, which can be found at https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Queenly enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Queenly accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Queenly to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.
<p>
When a user posts an ISO on Queenly, they state the price range that they are willing to pay for and describe the item that they are looking for within the categories of designer, color, silhouette. The user's size measurements will be incorporated through the ISO post by what they have inputted on their profile. User's ISO will be matched with new and existing posts of dresses for sale by other users (seller), and it is up to the user (buyer) to choose which one to purchase. A buyer can also purchase a dress through the New feed. The seller will earn 80% of the item's selling price and the 20% will be given to Queenly as a commission fee, to cover the costs associated with credit card processing, operations-related costs and building and maintaining the Queenly software.

BOOKINGS, SERVICE FEES AND FINANCIAL TERMS
<br>
Queenly charges a service fee to the User (the “Service Fee”), which is based on a percentage of the applicable listing price that a Buyer pays to a Seller (the “Item Price”). The Service Fee paid to Queenly is equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Selling Price and the User keeps eighty percent (80%) of the Selling Price. Shipping fees are paid for by the Buyer of the item and that goes to Queenly to cover both shipping and any damages/delays that may occur. Queenly will collect the Service Fees from time of payment and at the time payment is disbursed to such Seller, which is 2 days after the Buyer receives the item. Queenly assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of both Buyer and Seller. Buyers and Sellers are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed transactions and making available that item for purchase through the Site, Application and Services. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Queenly, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Queenly is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Queenly disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Queenly is not a party to the agreement between the Seller and the Buyer, Queenly accepts payments from you on behalf of the Buyer. Upon a Buyer's payment of the Item Price to Queenly, Buyer's payment obligation to the Seller for such amounts is fulfilled.
<p>
Users are responsible for reading Item Listings, including, without limitation, the description of the item and any policies or instructions. Queenly will collect the Item Price in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Queenly cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Buyer by his or her own bank related to Queenly’s collection of the Item Price, and Queenly disclaims all liability in this respect.
<p>
In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address, credit card information to Queenly’s third party payment processor, which is currently “Stripe” (www.Stripe.com). You agree to pay Queenly for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Queenly account in accordance with these Terms by credit card. You authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Queenly or indirectly, via our third party online payment processor. If you are directed to Queenly’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once you post an item for sale and the Buyer purchases, you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed transaction.
<p>
REFUNDS
<br>
Since Queenly is a third-party platform and we do not own any of the inventory, we currently do not accept/process any refunds. It is up to the Buyer to make sure that the correct size measurements are displayed on their profile and that they are responsible for accepting offers from Sellers that provide them with the proper size measurement matches. The items will go through an intensive quality check and dry cleaning through us prior to reaching the Buyer, and if for any reason we notice any discrepancies with the item that does not reflect what was described in the post, we will then send it back to the Seller and notify the Buyer with a full refund. The Seller is solely responsible for making sure that what they state about the item is true (i.e. right color, correct size measurements, honest condition of the item, etc.) and that Sellers understand that their items are subject the rejection if the item does not pass our quality check process.
<p>
FORCE MAJURE
<br>
Neither party shall be responsible or have any liability for any delay or failure to perform to the extent due to unforeseen circumstances or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, earthquake, fire, flood, embargoes, labor disputes and strikes, riots, war, acts of a public enemy, error in the coding of electronic files, Internet or other network “brownouts” or failures, power failures, cyber attacks, third party attack or other actions and acts of civil and military authorities.
<p>

Further, unless both you and Queenly otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
