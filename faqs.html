    </div>

<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
How does ISO work? aka how can I find the perfect dress for me?</p>
</h6>
</p>

<p>
1. Create a post that specifies your preference of color, size, designer (optional), style, price range, and click “Search”</p>
<p>
2. Our app will automatically match you to existing for-sale dresses that matches your ISO directly below.
</p>
<p>
3. If you see a dress that you want, you can purchase it by clicking “Buy”
</p>
<p>
4. Finish transaction by paying for the dress and choose shipping option & input shipping details.
</p>
<p>
5. The dress will then go through an intensive quality check process (right color, no tears/holes/stains, etc.) and once we approve it, we will go ahead and put it through dry cleaning. For some reason, if it fails to meet our quality standard check, we will refund you the money and send it back to the seller.
</p>
<p>
6. We will then neatly package it and ship it right to you! 
</p>
 
<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
How do I sell my dresses?</h6>
</p>
</p>
<p>
1. Upload all the dresses that you'd like to sell under the “Sell” tab
</p>
<p>
2. Upload photos of your dress, fill out the info, state the price that you’d like to sell it for (you keep 80% of it!), select the condition of the dress (based on our Terms of Service), and any additional notes you’d like to share, then click “Create”
</p>
<p>
3. Once your dress is purchased by another user, you will then receive an email notification for instructions on how to send it out and we will attach a prepaid shipping label to be printed out 
</p>
<p>
4. Put in any mailer box/packaging, and securely tape the prepaid shipping label outside of the box, where it is visible. Drop it off at any USPS locations or drop boxes. 
</p>
<p>
5. Once we receive your dress, we will perform a quality check to make sure the dress is what you had described (condition, color, size, quality, designer, etc.)
</p>
<p>
6. If denied (item is not what you described, there are damages that were not disclosed, etc.), we will send back the dress to you and you will not receive the amount paid for by the buyer.
</p>
<p>
7. If accepted, we will ship out the dress to the buyer and once it is received, we will disburse your commission (you keep 80% of the dress's value). We will disburse your earnings via PayPal, Venmo, or a check. This can take anywhere between 24-72 hours for electronic, and 5-7 days for a mail-in check.

<p class="font-weight-bold">
Can I be a buyer and a seller?</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p>
Definitely! As a user, you can post an ISO and buy a dress from one of the offers you receive on your post. You can also offer to sell any dresss that you possess. We try to promote a more sustainable fashion economy, and we know that by giving women access to each other's wardrobes of dresss, this can be achieved. 
</p>

<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
Do you guys have a rental feature?</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p>
We certainly recognize the need to take it a step further and to make it more sustainable for everyone, that is why we do plan to include this soon enough. We will notify all our users once this feature becomes available!

What is Queenly's mission?</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p>
Queenly is a peer-to-peer marketplace dedicated towards formal wear fashion and the pageant industry through the means of a buyer-driven model called ISO (in search of). Queenly's purpose is to remind girls everywhere that you don't have to break the bank to be confidently beautiful. For a fraction of the price, you can attain that dress that you've always wanted to rock on stage or glide in on the dance floor. We are not a retail store; we are a revolutionary platform focused on fashion and we foster a community that uplifts and strives to help one another look incredible and feel like a queen on their special night.
</p>
<p>
By reversing the typical buying process, we promote the idea of efficiency by giving the control to the buyers and letting the offers come to them instead. When preparing for a pageant competition or getting ready for a gala, girls already have in mind what kind of dress they want to wear. Whether it be the color, the style, the silhouette, etc., Queenly will give you the chance to let others know what you're looking for instead of browsing through different sites and scrolling endlessly on their inventory.

</p>
</p>
<p> 
Of course not! This app is for women of all ages (at least 13) that want to be queenly for any special event! Whether it be prom, homecoming, gala, red carpet, cotillion, quinceneara, wedding, etc., Queenly will make it easier for you to find something to wear. We only emphasize the pageant industry as this was the source of inspiration for the creation of the app, as pageant girls have been using pageant resale methods for years. We hope that the pageant industry can help us start with the traction that we need in order to let more women know about our handy platform.

<p class="font-weight-bold">
What is the whole point of ISO (in search of)?</h6>
</p>
</p>
<p>
As a founder and as a female, I know how extremely difficult it is to find a dress for an occasion. Not only that, but how expensive it is as well when buying brand new and/or custom-made. Being in the pageant industry for years now, and also being part of many community groups on social media dedicated for pageant resale, I saw how women were utilizing this method to save money and to also earn money from dresss they own. By reversing the typical buying process and giving the control to the buyer, the process becomes more efficient and saves a whole lot of time and headaches. Instead of browsing through different websites, and/or walking around various department or boutique stores flipping through dresss, we let the buyers state what they prefer and what they are looking for and let the offers come to them instead. By stating your size, preferred styles, designers, colors, and price range upfront, you will have a better and more seamless transaction rather than never-ending browsing or negotiations. 
</p>

<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
Who handles dry cleaning?</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p> 
In order to make it easier for our users, we take care of the dry cleaning in-house. That's why we handle everything in between, from the time that the seller ships us the dress to when it reaches the buyer's doors, we make sure that the dress is in perfect shape to give you your perfect look.
</p>

<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
What are your shipping options?</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p>
We will have 2 different shipping options for our buyers: normal shipping (7-10 days) and expedited shipping (3-5 days). We are currently utilizing USPS. The buyer will be responsible for paying for the shipping option. 
</p>

<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
How do refunds work?</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p>
Since we are a third-party platform and do not own any of the inventory, we currently do not accept any regular refund request. The exception to this is that if we missed anything during our quality check. After the receipt of delivery of the dress, you have 24 hours to report a refund request. Refunds are only given if there is a damage that is significantly present that we didn't catch during quality check, and the buyer must email us right away with photos that can certify the complaint. You cannot get a refund if it doesn't fit right, or if you simply don't like it. Since we are only a platform to connect users to share their wardrobes, and we do not own the inventory ourselves, we cannot promise a refund for every transaction if it is not our fault. We deeply apologize for this current inconvenience, but we hope you can understand, and once Queenly starts to gain more traction and success, we would love to provide a 100% guarantee refund in the near future. It is up to the buyer to check all of the info that the seller includes in the offer post, to guarantee that the sizes match and that all the preferences are correct.

How much do I get for the dress that I've sold on Queenly?
</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p>                    
To make sure we run our platform successfully for our users, we charge a 20% service fee on all transactions sold on Queenly. This is significantly lower than our competitors, so you'll be happy to know you're still keeping a big chunk of 80%. Through this process, we guarantee your safety online and that your transactions run through a trusted platform, excellent quality of dresss, and we take care of packaging and shipping so your experience is hassle-free so you can focus on looking and feeling like a queen!
</p>

<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
How will I get my earnings from my dress?</h6>
</p>
</p>

<p>
You will be able to see what you've earned off of your sold dress in your account after the buyer receives the package via email. We will disburse your commission (you keep 80% of the dress's value). Your earnings will be disbursed via PayPal, Venmo, or a physical check. This can take anywhere between 1-3 business days for electronic, and 3-5 days for a mail-in check.
</p>
<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
How do I ship the dress that I just sold to a buyer?</h6>
</p>
</p>
<p>
We will send you a shipping label once your offer has been accepted by the buyer and their payment transaction has gone through. We currently use USPS to ship out all items, and you can utilize any box/envelope/packaging you want, as long as the dress is secure and that you put the shipping label clearly visible on the outside. You can then drop it off at any USPS designated USPS blue collection box nearest you, or at any USPS location. 
</p>
<p>
<h6>
<p class="font-weight-bold">
What types of photo should I use for my offer?</h6>
</p>
</p>
<p>
We recommend to use a real-time photo of the dress, and please make sure that it is as clear as possible with a high resolution. Taking a photo in good natural lighting would be best, with the least amount of distractions in the background. Also, it would be great to take a photo of it being worn on a person's body, so the buyer can see how it fits and the length. If you don't have time to take one, you can just upload the retail photo from the store/designer's website from which you haves originally purchased it (but be certain that it is the same exact style and color).
